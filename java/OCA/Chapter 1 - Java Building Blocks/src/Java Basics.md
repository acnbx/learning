# Understanding the Java Class Structure

In Java a *class* is the basic building block.
When defining a class you must describe all the *methods* (operations it can perform) and *fields* (pieces of information it can hold) it has.
To use a class we typically must create an *instance* of it in memory.
All the various objects of the classes represent the *state* of the program.


## Fields and Methods

Java classes have two primary elements:
    
    methods - An operation that an be called; Also called functions or procedures.
    
    fields - Information that is held in memory; Also called a variable.

In combination these *methods* and *fields* are known as the *members* of the class.
